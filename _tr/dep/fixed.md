The multi-word expression (modifier) relation is one of the three relations ([compound](), `fixed`, [flat]()) for compounding.
It is used for certain fixed grammaticalized expressions that behave like function words or short adverbials.

We use ``fixed`` for some non-productive MWEs such as _eski pusku_, _paldır küldür_.
For productive reduplication, including m-reduplication [compound:redup](compound-redup) should be used.

A few fixed-like MWEs are analyzed as usual.
