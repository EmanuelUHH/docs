The `dislocated` relation is used for fronted or postposed elements that do not fulfill the usual core grammatical relations of a sentence.
These elements often appear to be in the periphery of the sentence,
and may be separated off with a comma intonation.

Following [UD general guidelines](u-dep/dislocated),
the dislocated element attaches to the head of the clause to which it belongs
(although this does not allow recovering what is dislocated).
