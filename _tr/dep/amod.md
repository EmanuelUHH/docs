An adjectival modifier of a noun is
any adjectival phrase that serves to modify the meaning of the noun.

`amod` is not used for adjectival modifiers of nouns.
We use [det]() for determiners (tagged [tr-pos/DET]()),
and for so-called "bare noun compounds",
where the modifier is a noun, we use [nmod]().
