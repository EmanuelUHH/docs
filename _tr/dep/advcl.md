An adverbial clause modifier is a clause which modifies
a verb or other predicate (adjective, etc.),
as a modifier not as a core complement. 
This includes things such as a temporal clause,
consequence, conditional clause, purpose clause, etc.
The dependent must be clausal (or else it is an [advmod]())
and the dependent is the main predicate of the clause.

Turkish adverbial clauses are mainly formed through morphological inflections.

~~~ sdparse
Kitabı okusaydın anlardın . \n You would understand if you had read the book
advcl(anlardın, okusaydın)

The subordinator _ki_ and a few other subordinating words may also form adverbial clauses.
