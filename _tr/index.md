# UD for Turkish <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/TR.svg" /></span>

This is a **work-in-progress** overview of the UD annotation for Turkish.

Unfortunately, different treebanks follow (slightly) different
annotation guidelines,
and at present (as of v2.4) multiple uncoordinated attempts of
correction efforts are known.


## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by white spaces or punctuation,
    Whitespaces or punctuation may appear in some abbreviations
    or numeric expressions.
* Clitics are treated as a separate words. This includes
    the clitics that follow word-internal processes (e.g., vowel
    harmony) such as question clitic  _mI_ and  adverbial _DA_.
* Due to the interaction of syntax and rich morphology,
    the following list  affixes introduce new "syntactic words".
        - Copular suffix attached to nouns or adverbs (if not null),
            including the conditional _-(y)sA_ and converbial _-(y)ken_
        - _-ki_
        - _-lI_
        - _-sIz_
        - _-lIk_

For more details, see [tokenization](tokenization.html).

## Morphology

Turkish has a rich inflectional and derivational morphology.
Some of the morphological phenomena are not satisfactorily annotated as of UD v2.
This includes some missing feature-value pairs,
e.g., 'reflexive voice' which is marked using language specific value ``Voice=Rfl``.
Another open issue is multiple values for certain UD morphological features.
For example, a _gelemeselerdi_ "if they were not able to come_ expresses
two different modalities, requiring assigning both ``Pot`` and ``Cnd``
to the [Mood](feat/mood) feature.
Currently these multiple features are expressed
by concatenating the values together in alphabetic order,
resulting in feature-value pairs like ``Mood=CndPot``.
Besides ``Mood``, ``Voice`` may also have multiple values.

### Tags

This is an overview only. For more detailed discussion and examples,
see the list of [Turkish POS tags](pos/index.html)
and [Turkish features](feat/index.html).

* The use of UD POS tags vary among different treebanks. ``PART`` is
    not used in any of the current treebanks.
* Negation particle _deÄŸil_ is marked either as ``AUX`` in some treebanks, and ``VERB`` in others.
* The question particle _mI_ is tagged as ``AUX``.
* The copular suffix -_(y)_-, which is treated as a syntactic word, and its clitic counterpart _i-_ is marked as AUX.
* Treatment of auxiliary/copula _ol_ differs among different treebanks.

## Syntax

see the list of [relations](dep/index.html),


### Relations Overview

* The following relation subtypes are used in Turkish:
   * [advmod:emph]()
   * [aux:q]()
   * [compound:lvc]()
   * [compound:redup]()
   * [nmod:poss]()
   * [nmod:tmod]()
   * [obl:tmod]()
   * [nsubj:cop]()
   * [csubj:cop]()
   * [nmod:part]()
   * [nmod:comp]()
   * [obl:agent]()

## Treebanks

As of v2.4, there are three treebanks, more treebanks are in progress.

  * [Turkish-GB](http://coltekin.github.io/gk-treebank/)
  * [Turkish-IMST](../treebanks/cs/index.html)
  * [Turkish-PUD](../treebanks/cs_pud/index.html)
