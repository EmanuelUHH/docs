### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech
(e.g., [adpositions](ADP), [coordinating conjunctions](CCONJ), [subordinating conjunctions](SCONJ) or [auxiliary verbs](AUX)).

### Examples
- _ci,l√†_ in demonstrative determiners such as _ce gars-<b>ci</b>_ "this guy"
- euphonic _t_ in "a-<b>t</b>-il" for example
