# Introduction

There are now three Norwegian UD treebanks. The Norwegian Bokmål and Nynorsk treebanks are conversions from the Norwegian
Dependency Treebank (NDT), which is a syntactic treebank of Norwegian. The Norwegian Nynorsk LIA treebank is based on the LIA treebank of transcribed spoken Norwegian dialects.

NDT was developed 2011-2014 at the National Library of Norway in collaboration
with the Text Laboratory and the Department of Informatics at the
University of Oslo. NDT has been automatically converted to the UD
scheme by Lilja Øvrelid at the University of Oslo.

The Norwegian LIA treebank consists of dialect recordings made in the
  period between 1950--1990, which have been digitised, transcribed,
  and subsequently annotated with morphological and dependency-style
  syntactic analysis as part of the [LIA (Language Infrastructure made
  Accessible)](http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/language-infrastructure-made-accessible/)  project at the University of Oslo. It has been automatically converted to the UD
scheme by Lilja Øvrelid at the University of Oslo.
