`Gender` in Erzya is a peripheral phenomenon attested only occasionally/archaically in the [proper nouns](myv-pos/PROPN), where a woman is given the name of her husband with the -низэ `wife` suffix attached.

#### Examples

* [myv] _Иван ды <b>Иваннызе</b>_ "Ivan and <b>Ivan's wife</b>"
* [myv] _Гава ды <b>Гаванизе</b>_ "Gava and <b>Gava's wife</b>"
