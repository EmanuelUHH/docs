In German, examples of this type of multiword expression are either written
as one composite word or as multiple individual words linked by hyphens.
Since these so-called Komposita are/should be annotated as single tokens,
the `compound` relation is not used here.

~~~ sdparse
Telefonbuch \n Telefon-Buch \n phone book
compound(phone, book)
~~~

However, if these Komposita were to be split up into syntactic words,
the individual words would be linked by the `compound` relation.

~~~ sdparse
*Telefon Buch
compound(*Telefon, Buch)
~~~

The subtype relation [compound:prt]() is used for particle verbs when
particle and verb are separated.
