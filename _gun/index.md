# UD for Mbyá Guaraní <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/PY.svg" /></span> <span class="flagspan" style="padding-left:1em"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/AR.svg" /></span> <span class="flagspan" style="padding-left:1em"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/BR.svg" /></span>

This is a brief overview of the UD annotation for Mbyá Guaraní. A full set of annotation guidelines can be downloaded at [gpythomas.com/Mbya_Treebank_Guidelines.pdf](gpythomas.com/Mbya_Treebank_Guidelines.pdf) and will be incorporated into the UD Mbya_Guarani documentation in the next release. 

These guidelines are very much a work in progress. They are meant to adapt [Dooley's (2015)](https://www.sil.org/resources/archives/72343) analysis of Mbyá to the UD framework:

* Dooley, Robert A. (2015). Léxico Guarani, Dialeto Mbyá -- com informações úteis para o ensino médio, a aprendizagem e a pesquisa lingüística Brasília, Brazil: Summer Institute of Linguistics. 

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by white spaces or punctuation, Whitespaces or punctuation may appear in some abbreviations or numeric expressions.

* In order to capture interactions between syntax and morphology, clause level nominalizers (including the suffix _-a_) and adverbializers (including the switch reference markers _vy_ and _ramo_) have been represented as syntactic words.

* Glottal stops are represented by the apostrophe, which can therefore be part of a word. Reduplicated units are joined to their host by a hyphen.

## Morphology

### Tags

* Mbyá uses all 17 Universal POS categories:

| Open class words | Closed class words | Other |
|------------------|--------------------|-------|
| ADJ              | ADP                | PUNCT |
| ADV              | AUX                | SYM   |
| INTJ             | CCONJ              | X     |
| NOUN             | DET                |       |
| PROPN            | NUM                |       |

|                  | SCONJ              |       |

### Features

* Verbs are inflected for person, number and clusivity:

	* Person has three possible values: 1, 2, 3.
	* Person uses the layers subj and obj.
	* Number has two possible values: Sing and Plur.
	* Number uses the layer psor.
	* Clusivity has two possible values, In and Ex.
	* Clusivity uses the layers subj and obj.

* Verbs have a subcategorization feature Subcat with two possible values: Int and Tran.

* Verbs have an optional form feature with four possible values: Part(iciple), Ser(ial), Post(posed verb), Prov(erb).

* Verbs have an optional Polarity feature with one possible value, Neg.

* Nouns can be used as predicates without copula, and inflect for person, number and clusivity like inactive intransitive verbs. They have Person, Number and Clusitivity features.

* Pronouns have a PronType feature with six possible values: Dem, Ind, Int, Neg, Prs, Tot.

## Syntax

### Core Arguments, Oblique Arguments and Adjuncts

* Subjects are noun phrases without postpositions that are the sole cross-referenced argument of intransitive verbs, or the argument of transitive verbs that is cross-referenced with an active agreement marker.

* Objects are noun phrases without postpositions that are cross-referenced on transitive verbs with inactive agreement markers. They may be followed by a differential object marker.

* Postpositional noun phrases are considered oblique.

### Non-verbal Clauses

* Mbyá Guaraní is an omnipredicative language. Nouns and other non-verbal open word classes can be used predicatively without copula. In certain environments, non-verbal predicates are introduced by the copula _iko_.

### Language Specific Syntactic Relations

* There are 6 relation subtypes in UD Mbya_Guarani:

| Relation			|	Description																						|
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| advmod:sentcon	| Adverbial modifier used as sentence initial discourse connective									|
| compound:svc		| Used for a variety of complex predicates, notably serial verb and postposed verb constructions	|
| discourse:q		| Used for question particles, whose head can be verbal or nominal									|
| dislocated:cleft	| Used for cleft constructions that lack a copula													|
| obl:sentcon		| Nominal modifier used as a sentence initial discourse connective									|
| parataxis:rep		| Used to relate a reported speech form to a verb of speech report analyzed as its head				|
