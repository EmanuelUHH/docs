# UD for Assyrian <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IQ-AII.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Words are generally delimited by whitespace or punctuation.
* Punctuation marks are attached to the neighboring word. We always tokenize them as separate tokens.
* Coordinating conjunction and prepositions are separated from the words that follows them in a sentence.
* Multiword tokens are not used in Assyrian.

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.

## Morphology

### Tags

* The tags INT, SYM and X are not used.
* In this Assyrian treebank, 13 universal tags have been used.
* Certain words like "ܒܜ , ܩܡ ,ܟܝ , ܚܘܫ , ܫܘܩ" are tagged as PART and have a dependency relation as AUX. Together with the following VERB, these words change the verb tense.

---
**Instruction**: Specify any unused tags. Explain what words are tagged as PART. Describe how the AUX-VERB and DET-PRON distinctions are drawn, and specify whether there are (de)verbal forms tagged as ADJ, ADV or NOUN. Include links to language-specific tag definitions if any.

---

### Features

* Nominal words (NOUN, PROPN and PRON) have an inherent Gender feature with values Masc or Fem.
* Verbs inflect for Gender, Number and Person.
* Number has 2 possible values: Sing and Plur.

---
**Instruction**: Describe inherent and inflectional features for major word classes (at least NOUN and VERB). Describe other noteworthy features. Include links to language-specific feature definitions if any.
