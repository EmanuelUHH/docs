## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Description of exceptions follows.
* According to typographical rules, some punctuation marks (e.g., comma) are attached to a neighboring word,
  while others are not.
  We tokenize punctuation as separate tokens (words).

## Morphology

### Tags

* Urdu uses all 17 universal POS categories, including particles ([PART]()).
* Urdu has the following auxiliary verbs ([AUX]()): <!-- In Hindi by Rupert Snell, see also Appendix 7 on pages 258, 259. -->
  * ہے _hai_ and تھا _thā_ are present and past equivalents of “to be”.
    They are used as copulas and in periphrastic tenses.
  * رہ _rah_ (“to stay”) for the progressive aspect (with the stem of the main verb and the auxiliary ہے/تھا).
  * کر _kar_ (“to do”) for the habitual aspect (with the perfective participle of the main verb).
  * جا _jā_ (“to go”) for the passive (with the perfective participle of the main verb).
  * Modal auxiliaries:
    * سک _sak_ (“be able, can”) <!-- Page 153. -->
    * پا _pā_ (“to manage”) <!-- Page 153. -->
    * چاہیئے _cāhie_ (“needed, should, ought to”) <!-- Page 91, 164. -->
    * ہو _ho_ (“to have to”) <!-- Page 165. -->
    * پڑ _paṛ_ (“must”) <!-- Pages 165, 166. -->
  * Phase verbs:
    * لگ _lag_ (“to start”) <!-- Page 171 is mostly about other meaning, to strike, to like. -->
    * چک _cuk_ (“to finish”) <!-- Page 153. -->
  * The current data treats as auxiliaries also some verbs that regularly appear in compound verbs
    as the semantically less salient element. Since compound verbs are not periphrastic tense/aspect/voice
    forms, these verbs do not fit well in the UD definition of auxiliaries, and they should be given
    a different analysis in the future releases. The following verbs are used as semantic auxiliaries
    in compound verbs:
    * جا _jā_ (“to go”) (note that this verb can also be used as real auxiliary in passives)
    * لے _le_ (“to take”)
    * دے _de_ (“to give”)
    * डाल _ḍāla_ (“to throw”) <!-- The second batch of compound verbs is described on pages 220–222. To throw gives a sense of vigorousness. -->
    * پڑ _paṛ_ (“to fall”) (note that this verb can also be used as modal “must”) <!-- Adds a sense of suddenness or change of state. -->
    * بیٹھ _baiṭh_ (“to sit”) <!-- Adds a sense of foolishness or stubbornness. -->
    * उठ _uṭh_ (“to rise”)
    * رکھ _rakh_ (“to keep”) <!-- Adds a sense of firmness. -->
    * آ _ā_ (“to come”)
