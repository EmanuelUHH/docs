# UD for Hindi <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IN.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Description of exceptions follows.
* According to typographical rules, some punctuation marks (e.g., comma) are attached to a neighboring word,
  while others (e.g., the sentence-terminating danda) are not.
  We tokenize punctuation as separate tokens (words).

## Morphology

### Tags

* Hindi uses all 17 universal POS categories, including particles ([PART]()).
* Hindi has the following auxiliary verbs ([AUX]()): <!-- In Hindi by Rupert Snell, see also Appendix 7 on pages 258, 259. -->
  * है _hai_ and था _thā_ are present and past equivalents of “to be”.
    They are used as copulas and in periphrastic tenses.
  * रह _raha_ (“to stay”) for the progressive aspect (with the stem of the main verb and the auxiliary ह/था).
  * कर _kara_ (“to do”) for the habitual aspect (with the perfective participle of the main verb).
  * जा _jā_ (“to go”) for the passive (with the perfective participle of the main verb).
  * Modal auxiliaries:
    * सक _saka_ (“be able, can”) <!-- Page 153. -->
    * पा _pā_ (“to manage”) <!-- Page 153. -->
    * चाहिए _cāhie_ (“needed, should, ought to”) <!-- Page 91, 164. -->
    * हो _ho_ (“to have to”) <!-- Page 165. -->
    * पड़ _paṛa_ (“must”) <!-- Pages 165, 166. -->
  * Phase verbs:
    * लग _laga_ (“to start”) <!-- Page 171 is mostly about other meaning, to strike, to like. -->
    * चुक _cuka_ (“to finish”) <!-- Page 153. -->
  * The current data treats as auxiliaries also some verbs that regularly appear in compound verbs
    as the semantically less salient element. Since compound verbs are not periphrastic tense/aspect/voice
    forms, these verbs do not fit well in the UD definition of auxiliaries, and they should be given
    a different analysis in the future releases. The following verbs are used as semantic auxiliaries
    in compound verbs:
    * जा _jā_ (“to go”) (note that this verb can also be used as real auxiliary in passives)
    * ले _le_ (“to take”)
    * दे _de_ (“to give”)
    * डाल _ḍāla_ (“to throw”) <!-- The second batch of compound verbs is described on pages 220–222. To throw gives a sense of vigorousness. -->
    * पड़ _paṛa_ (“to fall”) (note that this verb can also be used as modal “must”) <!-- Adds a sense of suddenness or change of state. -->
    * बैठ _baiṭha_ (“to sit”) <!-- Adds a sense of foolishness or stubbornness. -->
    * उठ _uṭha_ (“to rise”)
    * रख _rakha_ (“to keep”) <!-- Adds a sense of firmness. -->
    * आ _ā_ (“to come”)
